 - PROBLEM STATEMENT     
    As our project is connecting other restaurant outlets with users our website gives the base to connect restaurants with its customers. At the same time, it allows the individual restaurant/outlets to manage their menu and orders.  Trying to make the problem more obvious. Because of the fact that the project is in abstract state now, we tried to concretize the project. To achieve that, we tried to think about the similar software examples that are used in real life, like Zomato or Swiggy. One of the reasons to do that was to draw the borders of the problem, how much we can achieve. After drawing the borders of the problem, we divided the solution into several parts, which may change during the development of the project.
